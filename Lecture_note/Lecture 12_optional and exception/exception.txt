Exceptions are a way for handling errors when they arise in code by "thrown" them
so that we can write code that let us handle exceptions in order to continue in our code without necessarily erroring
try{
    //code that we check for exceptions -> using throw to catch exceptions
catch([exceptional type] e1){
    // behaviors when we encounter an error 
}
catch([exception type] e2){

}
}
